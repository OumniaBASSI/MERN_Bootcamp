Variables are containers for values that our program depends on. Knowing that we can adjust  our algorithm 

# when 
Variables are used in programming whenever you need to store and manipulate data.

# how
```javascript
var name = <value>;
let name = <value>;
const name = <value>;
```

The variable name has to follow some rules:


- Variable name can contain: letters (uppercase & lowercase), numbers, underscore (`_`) and dollar sign (`$`)

- Variable names must start with a letter, an underscore (`_`) or a dollar sign (`$`).

- Variable names cannot contain spaces.

- Variables cannot be the same as reserved keywords such as `if` or `const`.

### Var, Let, and Const â€“ What's the Difference?&#x20;

* **var :** it's the old way of declaring variables in javascript. It introduces some problems and unexpected behavior, this is why javascript introduced `let` and `const` in 2015 (ES6).
* **let :** is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to `var` declarations. It also solves the problem with `var`
* **const :** variables declared with the `const` maintain constant values.
