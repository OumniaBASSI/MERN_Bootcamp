# Intro to loops

- It's to automate repitition
    * save time and effort
    * handle large datasets
    * create dynamic experinece

- when we use it 
    * repetitive tasks
    * iterating throught data
    * creating simulation
    
## how 
  * **For loop**
  * **While loop**
  * **Do-While loop**

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    console.log(i);
}
```

it's like telling your program to repeat console.log(i) statement, starting from the number 0, and upwards, until the current value of i is equal or grater that 10.
