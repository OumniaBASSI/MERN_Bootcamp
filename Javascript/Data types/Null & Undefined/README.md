# Null & Undefined

## Null
 - represents the intentional absence of a value
 - used to explicitly indicate that a variable has no assigned value
 - use it when you want to clear a variable or indicate that it doesn't contain any data

 ### how

 ```javascript
 let favoriteColor = null; // no value assigned yet
```

## Undefined

- represent teh absence of a value by default
- used to indicate a variable has'nt been declared or assigned a value 
- when you declare a variable without assigning it a value
- does'nt require any explicit declaration, it's implicit

```javascript
let age; // undefined untill assigned 
```
