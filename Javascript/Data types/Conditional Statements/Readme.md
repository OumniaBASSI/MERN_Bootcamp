# Conditional Statements
JavaScript conditionals function similarly to digital decision-makers.  They enable your program to make decisions according to predetermined criteria.  The software follows one path if certain conditions are met, and another if they are not.

- Conditionals provide flexibility and control in your code

- Conditionals come into play when you need your program to behave differently based on specific conditions

## how

```javascript
let wantsSugar = true;

if (watsSugar) {
    console.log("Adding sugar to the coffee!");
} else {
    consol.log("Enjoy your black coffee!");
}
```

 - we use if...else statements to express the decision making process using the following syntax : 

 ```javascript
 if (<condition>) {
    <Action>
 } else if (<condition>) {
    <Action>
 } else {
    <Action>
 }
```
