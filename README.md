# 🚀 MERN Full Stack Bootcamp — Arkx Factory

Welcome to my personal notes and progress from the **Arkx Factory Full Stack JavaScript Bootcamp**!  
This repository includes everything I'm learning about the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), as well as tools, concepts, and mini-projects.


This bootcamp is a hands-on journey into full-stack JavaScript development. I'm using this repository to:

- Document what I learn
- Practice with mini-projects
- Track my growth as a developer
